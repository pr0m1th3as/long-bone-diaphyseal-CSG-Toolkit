# long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit
A GNU Octave toolkit for analyzing diaphyseal long bone cross sectional geometry

The present set of GNU Octave functions provides a novel and robust algorithm for
analyzing the diaphyseal cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones, which
can be applied to any 3D digital model of a humerus, femur or tibia bone represented
as a triangular mesh in a Wavefront OBJ file format.

The CSG Toolkit requires the 'io >= 2.4.12', 'statistical >= 1.4.1' and 'matgeom-1.2.2'
packages to be installed. Reading the .obj mesh files is performed with the readObj.oct file,
which should be compiled before its use (the .oct binary is provided for reference purposes)
This can be compiled from the source file 'readObj.cc' from within GNU Octave environment by
issuing the following command

     mkoctfile readObj.cc

The CSG Toolkit can be called in batch processing mode using the 'longbone_Analysis.m'
script which can handle all available 3D models found in OBJ format in the working
directory as long as a specific bone, i.e. humerus, femur or tibia, is selected. Type

     help longbone_Analysis

for information about its usage. The CSG Toolkit also provides functionality for
graphical representation of the cross-sectional contours and their respective CSG
properties, which can be accessed with the 'visualize_CrossSections.m' function by
reading the output results of the longbone_Analysis stored in relevant CSV files. When
numerous samples have been analyzed in batch mode, the function 'inspect_CSG.m' can also
be used to facilitate their visual inspection according to the files present in the working
directory. Furthermore, 'inspect_CSG.m' will assemble all calculated values in tabular
form and save them in a CSV file. Type 

     help inspect_CSG

for more information about how to use 'inspect_CSG.m' and the layout of the resulting CSV file.

The present toolkit has been extensively tested and these results are presented
in the relevant validation study available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.1466135.
The testing dataset, which comprises three 3D mesh models of real humans bones 
(a humerus, a femur and a tibia, which are part of the Athens modern reference
skeletal collection), is also freely available at doi:10.5281/zenodo.1466962 and 
may be used with the CSG Toolkit for demonstrating its operation. Please, when using this toolkit,
