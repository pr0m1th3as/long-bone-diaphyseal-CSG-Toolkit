Summary of important changes for releases of the long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit
===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.0.0  Release Date: 2018-10-04  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

** Initial release.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.0.1  Release Date: 2018-10-19  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

** First official release.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.1.0  Release Date: 2020-05-07  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Updated dependency from geometry<=3.0.0 to matgeom>=1.2.1 package
* c++ implementation of the 'slice_Mesh_Plane' function, which posed
a bottlenen in performance. Processing time of a typical 300k faces model
has been reduced from ~50 seconds to less than 3 seconds.
* An additional function 'inspect_CSG' has been added to help visualizing
the analyzed cross-sections in batch mode and consolidate all calculated
variables from batch-produced csv files by 'longbone_Analysis' into a single
CSV file. Type 'help inspect_CSG' for more info.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.0  Release Date: 2021-04-17  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* An additional function 'longbone_Registration' has been added to automatically
determine bone and register the required initial alignment points.
* Updated functionality in longbone_Analysis and longbone_Geometry to include
the new capabilities of 'longbone_Registration' in batch processing.
* Removed precompiled binaries.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.1  Release Date: 2021-18-04  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

** First package resease.

A GNU Octave package for analyzing diaphyseal cross sectional geometry.

The present package is based on the long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit and has
been created to simplify its installation and usage from within GNU Octave.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.2  Release Date: 2022-05-06  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Removed dependency of matgeom and statistics packages.
* longbone_maxDistance has been ported to C++ to speed up processing time.
* Renamed function: slice_Mesh_plane -> meshSection.
* Added functions for 3D meshes: writeObj, renameObj, meshArea, meshBarycenter.
* An additional function 'longbone_Scaling' has been added to facilitate batch
scaling of long bone models produced with 3D photogrammetry that lack real
world scale.  Type 'help longbone_Scaling' for more info.
* Additional core functionality with the new longbone_CustomGeometry function, 
which allows an arbitrary number of user defined cross section to be analyzed.
Type 'help longbone_CustomGeometry' for more info.
* Updated functionality in visualize_CrossSections function to include the new
capabilities of the 'longbone_CustomGeometry' function.
Type 'help visualize_CrossSections' for more info.
* Updated help files to texinfo format.
